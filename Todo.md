# Coding Exercise

Welcome to the DevPubs web front end team coding exercise! Its goal is to help us better understand your front end development skill set, familiarity with modern web technologies, and general approach to solving design and development challenges.

We anticipate the time spent on this exercise to take about an afternoon (3-4 hours) if you're proficient in the various technologies we're asking you to use (JavaScript, Node.js, and React). Please do not go over the alotted time. We're not looking for a perfectly polished, fully-featured product that's ready to ship to customers; we want to understand how you approach the process of building a product from scratch.

Although this exercise is intended to be quick and simple, unit testing, code style, user experience, and good design sense are important to us. We encourage you to think deeply about these areas in favor of coming up with the quickest solution.

# The Task

You've probably used a to-do list of some form in the past: a mobile app, a website, or just a pad of paper and a pen. For this coding exercise, we're asking you to build a simple **to-do list web app**. A user should be able to launch your app in a web browser and interact with it to create and manipulate a to-do list.

## Requirements

To-do list apps can get pretty fully-featured, so to help scope down the problem, we're asking you to implement a limited set of behaviors. At a minimum, your to-do list app should support the following capabilities:

- Adding new items
- Marking items as complete
- Marking items as incomplete (un-mark a previously complete item)
- Deleting items

Feel free to incorporate any other features that you feel are necessary for a simple to-do list web app to have. A few ideas are the ability to reorder items, undo/redo for deleting items, etc.

## Tools and Technologies

Your web app should make use of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Some additional technologies you may choose to include are CSS/Sass or another preprocessor, a JS task runner, a testing framework, and anything else you believe would be beneficial.

## Submitting the Project

Please send a link from GitHub or a zipped archive of the project to Alex.
